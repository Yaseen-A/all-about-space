<p>1 space exploration is the process of exploring the regions of the universe beyond Earth's atmosphere using crewed and uncrewed spacecraft, and then using the knowledge gathered to advance humankind's understanding of the universe. The Chronology of Crewed Spaceflights section contains a comprehensive record of all crewed spaceflights, together with information on the crew and achievements of each mission.  </p>
